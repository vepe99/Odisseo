They also enable comparisons with analytical models and {FokkerPlanck} or Monte Carlo methods. {NBODY}6 is a well-known direct N-body code for star clusters, and {NBODY}6++ is the extended version designed for large particle number simulations by supercomputers. We present {NBODY}6++{GPU}, an optimized version of {NBODY}6++ with hybrid parallelization methods ({MPI}, {GPU}, {OpenMP}, and {AVX}/{SSE}) to accelerate large direct N-body simulations, and in particular to solve the million-body problem. We discuss the new features of the {NBODY}6++{GPU} code, benchmarks, as well as the &#64257;rst results from a simulation of a realistic globular cluster initially containing a million particles. For million-body simulations, {NBODY}6++{GPU} is 4002000 times faster than {NBODY}6 with 320 {CPU} cores and 32 {NVIDIA} K20X {GPUs}. With this computing cluster speci&#64257;cation, the simulations of million-body globular clusters including 5 per cent primordial binaries require about an hour per half-mass crossing time.},

  abstract   = {The numerical simulations of massive collisional stellar systems, such as globular clusters ({GCs}), are very time-consuming. Until now, only a few realistic million-body simulations of {GCs} with a small fraction of binaries (5\%) have been performed by using the {NBODY}6++{GPU} code. Such models took half a year computational time on a {GPU} based super-computer. In this work, we develop a new N-body code, {PeTar}, by combining the methods of Barnes-Hut tree, Hermite integrator and slow-down algorithmic regularization ({SDAR}). The code can accurately handle an arbitrary fraction of multiple systems (e.g. binaries, triples) while keeping a high performance by using the hybrid parallelization methods with {MPI}, {OpenMP}, {SIMD} instructions and {GPU}. A few benchmarks indicate that {PeTar} and {NBODY}6++{GPU} have a very good agreement on the long-term evolution of the global structure, binary orbits and escapers. On a highly configured {GPU} desktop computer, the performance of a million-body simulation with all stars in binaries by using {PeTar} is 11 times faster than that of {NBODY}6++{GPU}. Moreover, on the Cray {XC}50 supercomputer, {PeTar} well scales when number of cores increase. The ten million-body problem, which covers the region of ultra compact dwarfs and nuclearstar clusters, becomes possible to be solved.},
